        <h4 class="subheading"> Dear Ms Catherine DE BOLLE, </h4>

        <br><br>

        <p class="text-muted">Journalists faced diverse threats in the European Union, including arrests, subpoenas to identify sources, and tragically killings. Your comments suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
          <br><br> 1.) The International crime & Oraganised crime threat - we must stop it.

          <br><br> 2.) Ján Kuciak (17 May 1990 – 21 February 2018) was a Slovak investigative journalist. Kuciak worked as a reporter for the news website in European Union. He and his fiancée, Martina Kušnírová, were shot dead in February 2018 in their
          home in European Union.

          <br><br> 3.) Ján Kuciak submitted a criminal complaint to the Prosecutor’s Office after being threatened by a Slovak businessman, and subsequently stated that 44 days after the submission the case was not assigned to a police officer and was
          closed with no witness hearing held.

          <br><br> 4.) Slovak police have been accused of destroying evidence, lack of transparency and inappropriately investigating Kuciak's peers. The case brought down the government, while the role of the police remains far from transparent. https://bit.ly/2KW4fNE
          <br><br> 5.) Europol is the European Union’s law enforcement agency. Headquartered in The Hague, the Netherlands, we assist the 28 EU Member States in their fight against serious international crime.

          <br><br> 6.) If you have information about a crime that either is being planned or has already been committed, or if you are the victim of a crime, you need to contact your local or national police. The authorities will contact Europol if required.
          Europol can deal only with information provided by the appropriate law enforcement agencies, not members of the public. https://www.europol.europa.eu/report-a-crime
          <br><br> 7.) But now, it's a crime scene. And we have the evidence. And it is not enough to say that Europol will do better in the future. When these people feel impunity, they commit even more violence. Why don’t we allow more people to speak
          on the issues of human rights? Now is the time to put the spotlight on an issue which has often been ignored or superseded by others. The killing of Victoria Marinova, Daphne Caruana Galizia, Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová - journalist to
          be killed in an EU member state - represents is a crime against us all everyone in Europe and beyond. Human rights are the opportunity to defend what we truly believe in. It’s not only in the UN, not only Article 2 of the Treaty on European
          Union, it’s in love, compassion and empathy. We still need answers: - whether Europol is the European Union’s law enforcement agency knew, or ought to have known, of a present and immediate threat to Jan Kuciak's life; - which steps, if any,
          they took to protect him; - and what will be done to protect European Union journalists and human rights defenders in the future. Europol is the European Union’s law enforcement agency should support Member state of the European Union to find
          new ways to protect human rights defenders, journalists facing immediate risk through the emergency helpline run by Europol is the European Union’s law enforcement agency. The Europol should be involved as much as possible in the development
          and scrutiny of the above mentioned proposals. Legal basis Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union: EU values. The EU’s founding values are ‘human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including
          the rights of persons belonging to minorities’. On Human Rights for more information: the Charter of Fundamental Rights. –The protection of fundamental rights in the EU – http://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/en/sheet/146/the-protection-of-fundamental-rights-in-the-eu
          The investigation should also focus on why European Union authorities failed to protect Kuciak and Kušnírová. When a person reports severe threats to the police the national authorities, and the intertalional authorities have the legal obligation
          to protect that person in the European Union.

          <br><br> 8.) The work of human rights defenders is essential for the advancement of human rights, democracy and the rule of law.

        <h4 class="white-text-with-blue-shadow">One of the Global Investigative Journalism Circle of Jan Kuciak Strategies for Human Rights Education's flagship reports, the serious and organised crime in the European Union</h4>
        <h4 class="subheading"></h4>
        <p class="text-muted">In an environment of intimidation, threats, political interference and impunity, investigative journalists have to fear for their lives to fulfil their work and report on corruption and other threats to democracy. The value of independent journalism
          and free media should not be put into question.
          <br><br> We report corruption on citizens' life, but nothing happens. They enjoy impunity, then they attack us. Eventually it leads to the murder of a human rights defenders.

          <br><br> I was one of the few people who informed the Europol is the European Union’s law enforcement agency – EU public – what was really happening: Human rights are something so basic, but so important. The Europol is the European Union’s
          law enforcement agency media totally closed their eyes to what was going on in our region.

          <br><br> The Global Investigative Journalism Circle of Jan Kuciak Strategies for Human Rights Education we’ve opened up a conversation that people have been unable to have until now. We are just one voice from the region, but I hope it opens
          the doors for others.

          <br><br> I didn’t have the resources to fight back against the Europol. The Global Investigative Journalism Circle of Jan Kuciak Strategies for Human Rights Education work with human rights defenders at investigative journalism across the EU,
          to help them discover and tell important International Public Goods.

          <br><br> We look forward to a successful working relationship in the future. Please, contact me if you have any comments or questions about this information.
          <br><br> The Global Investigative Journalism Circle of Jan Kuciak Strategies for Human Rights Education explored in EU. One of the Global Investigative Journalism Circle of Jan Kuciak Strategies for Human Rights Education's flagship reports,
          the serious and organised crime in the European Union:
          <br><br> I.) Illegal arms trade that has to do with human rights defenders
          <br><br> killed not only Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová;
          <br><br> II.) Source that continually pollutes the environment: A- tetraklór-etilén, B - toluol, C - triklór-etilén, D - cisz-1,2-diklór-etilén, E - 1,1,1-triklór-etán, F - BTEX: benzol deriving from a disused industrial site. According to studies,
          remediation was not feasible in the short-term;
          <br><br> III.) Illegal detention centers;

          <br><br> IV.) Torture and illegal executions;
          <br><br> V.) There is no independent and public database that human rights – including arrests, subpoenas to identify sources, and tragically killings [...] – as a journalist & human rights defenders have been violated in the European Union.

          <br><br> Yours sincerely, Mihaly Felfoldi
